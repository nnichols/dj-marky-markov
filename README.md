## Archival

This project was a pet project I took on while learning clojure, I sincerely hope you weren't relying on it in production!
To free myself of automated alerts/dependency updates/etc, I'm archiving the repository as of 2025-01-03.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine.

## Usage

To see how the application works, try executing it:

```bash
~/dj-marky-markov (master)
$ lein run ./test/dj_marky_markov/test.txt 3 10
```

Shortly after, you should see results like the following printed back to you in stdout:

```txt
And that's when it becomes fun - you just let it play back-and-forth.
Let all these little delicate things.
What the devil.
We'll put a touch more of the brush and let it go.
We'll put a touch more of the land.
Look at them little rascals.
That's your challenge for the day.
Just use the old one inch brush.
Christmas tree things we used to make it that way.
I may have to see things when you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing these little things in your heart.
```

If your results sound eerily familiar to [everyone's favorite painter,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross) then everything is set up correctly!
