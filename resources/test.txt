Hello
Two words
A longer line
One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke.
One morning, when Nick Nichols woke.
Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.
No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people.
Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.
We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. Trees grow however makes them happy. Poor old tree. We don't have anything but happy trees here. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. Don't fight it, use what happens. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy.
Here we're limited by the time we have. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue
Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Everybody needs a friend. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. You have to make these big decisions.
Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Let's get crazy. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. I'm a water fanatic. I love water.
There we go. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. There are no limits in this world. This is your world. I like to beat the brush. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Let your imagination be your guide.
If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.
Play with the angles. Let's do that again.
Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. Those great big fluffy clouds. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen.
The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud.
In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Brown is such a nice color. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you.
Look at them little rascals. We'll put a happy little bush here. It is a lot of fun. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.
The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. This is the fun part Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Just beat the devil out of it. If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.
How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.
That easy. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. Use what you see, don't plan it.
This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world.
Every time you practice, you learn more. Zip. That easy.
Let's make a happy little mountain now. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. This is the time to get out all your frustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse.
